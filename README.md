# pywaves
Random studying of Digital Signal Processing

Some experiments with DSP generating, analyzing and combining soundwaves.

Main goals are:
  * To learn :)
  * To have fun :D
  * To play with some dirty psychedelic sounds...
  * ...And visualize them!

Main Application goals are:
  * Have a nice API to work with sound generation
    - heavily inspired in [ThinkDSP's work](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkDSP)
  * Have a simple UI to (in real time):
    - Create and control Sinusoid wave sounds
    - Combine them
    - Control them
    - Visualize them
